# iOS Exercise

## Context

Create a 2-screen app using https://openweathermap.org/api.
First screen shows a list of cities of your choice, current temperature there and an icon of the
weather (can be either provided from Open Weather api or the design).

Second screen shows detailed information about the selected city: you can choose any info
you‚Äôd like to show from the response or stick to the info in the design.

Here is the link to the design for the task:
https://share.goabstract.com/55d2ea46-a48c-43e1-9b45-47e87f85e152. It was designed for
iPhone 11, but please make sure it looks good (similar) on smaller screens and iPad, too.

## Requirements

- Use UIKit for UI
- Don‚Äôt use 3rd party libraries

## Nice to have:

- MVVM architecture
- Unit tests
- UI that looks close to the one in the provided design

# Jorge's Palomino Feedback

* Run the app and you will see the default cities displayed as requested.
* You can add and remove cities to your favourites.
* Shutting down & opening it again and your favourite cities will be persistent.
* Scroll to the top and search for a new city.
* Friendly UI with colour scheme as requested per design.
